        <p>The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations
            are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the
            start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
            permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the
            last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and
            surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest,
            Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding
            large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand
            marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings),
            as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Clubâ€”a predominantly African American krewe. Float riders
            traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads,
            doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys. Major krewes follow the
            same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
            upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also
            take place downtown in the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras day.
            Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.</p>

            The Rex pageant, Mardi Gras Day, New Orleans, La., c. 1907
            The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River
            in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their
            men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of
            the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music
            and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An
            account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
            masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
            renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny
            de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras
            celebration.

            James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans
            Mardi Gras in 1835:

            Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun,
            frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active
            operation. Men and boys, women and girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert
            themselves to invent and appear in grotesque, quizzical, diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and
            disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds, beasts and birds with human heads;
            demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the moon; mermaids;
            satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts, coaches,
            cars, &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming,
            fiddling, fifeing, and all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

            In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to
            observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick
            Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what
            New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than
            this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a
            certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans
            'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess
            helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
            passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the
            nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to
            compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans
            culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."

            In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather
            conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American
            Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.

            In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
            surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual
            came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops
            maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce
            laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community
            recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

            In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including
            Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
            gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the
            law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the
            long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protestâ€”and
            because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership
            listsâ€”the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992
            Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

            Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two
            federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment
            rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the
            ordinance. The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays
            dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.</p>

                <p>
                    LaToya Cantrell (nÃ©e Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of
                    New Orleans, Louisiana, a post she has held since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first
                    woman to hold the post. Before becoming mayor, Cantrell represented District B on the New Orleans
                    City Council from 2012â€“2018.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cantrell was born as LaToya Wilder in Los Angeles. She moved to New Orleans in 1990 to attend Xavier
                    University of Louisiana, where she earned a BA in sociology. She attended an executive training
                    program at the Harvard Kennedy School.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the city's
                    history. Once in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of
                    creating a strategic plan to address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun
                    Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push
                    to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her
                    #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks, and green
                    spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
                    against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.

                    During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement
                    with Governor John Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50
                    million in upfront funding for the city's infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual
                    recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans
                    voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the
                    2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
                    properties, as well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule
                    Charter.
